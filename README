What is chos?
 A monolithic kernel.
 (This is my second time to write this, the original one is discarded.)

Quick start?
  # make          <- compile and generate bootable disk image
  # make loaduser <- install basic usermode programs into disk image
  # make bochs    <- run it in bochs

Debug?
  # make debug
  # gdb -q [boot/boot.elf | kernel.elf | user/init]
  ...
  # vim [boot/boot.asm | kernel.asm | user/init.asm]
  ...
  # grep "some symbol" [boot/boot.sym | kernel.sym | user/init.sym]
  ...
